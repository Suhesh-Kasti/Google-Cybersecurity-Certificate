|**Devices / Tools**|**Advantages**|**Disadvantages**|
|---|---|---|
|Firewall|A firewall allows or blocks traffic based on a set of rules.|A firewall is only able to filter packets based on information provided in the header of the packets.|
|Intrusion Detection System (IDS)|An IDS detects and alerts admins about possible intrusions, attacks, and other malicious traffic.|An IDS can only scan for known attacks or obvious anomalies; new and sophisticated attacks might not be caught. It doesnâ€™t actually stop the incoming traffic.|
|Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)|An IPS monitors system activity for intrusions and anomalies and takes action to stop them.|An IPS is an inline appliance. If it fails, the connection between the private network and the internet breaks. It might detect false positives and block legitimate traffic.|
|Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)|A SIEM tool collects and analyzes log data from multiple network machines. It aggregates security events for monitoring in a central dashboard.|A SIEM tool only reports on possible security issues. It does not take any actions to stop or prevent suspicious events.|
