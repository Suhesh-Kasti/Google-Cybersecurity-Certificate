All organizations must develop their security posture. Security posture is an organizationâ€™s ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change. Elements of the security and risk management domain that impact an organization's security posture include:

-   Security goals and objectives
    
-   Risk mitigation processes
    
-   Compliance
    
-   Business continuity plans
    
-   Legal regulations
    
-   Professional and organizational ethics
    

Information security, or InfoSec, is also related to this domain and refers to a set of processes established to secure information. An organization may use playbooks and implement training as a part of their security and risk management program, based on their needs and perceived risk. There are many InfoSec design processes, such as:

-   Incident response
    
-   Vulnerability management
    
-   Application security
    
-   Cloud security
    
-   Infrastructure security
    

As an example, a security team may need to alter how personally identifiable information (PII) is treated in order to adhere to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
