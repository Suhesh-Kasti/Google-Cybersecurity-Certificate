## Prepare
Prepare refers to activities that are necessary to manage security and privacy risks before a breach occurs. 
Eg. As an entry-level analyst, you'll likely use this step to monitor for risks and identify controls that can be used to reduce those risks.

## Categorize 
It is used to develop risk management processes and tasks. Security professionals then use those processes and develop tasks by thinking about how the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and information can be impacted by risk. 
Eg. As an entry-level analyst, you'll need to be able to understand how to follow the processes established by your organization to reduce risks to critical assets, such as private customer information.

## Select
Select means to choose, customize, and capture documentation of the controls that protect an organization. 
Eg. As an entry-level analyst, you'll be keeping a playbook up-to-date or helping to manage other documentation that allows you and your team to address issues more efficiently.

## Implement
implement security and privacy plans for the organization. Having good plans in place is essential for minimizing the impact of ongoing security risks. 
Eg, if you notice a pattern of employees constantly needing password resets, implementing a change to password requirements may help solve this issue.

## Assess 
Assess means to determine if established controls are implemented correctly. An organization always wants to operate as efficiently as possible. So it's essential to take the time to analyze whether the implemented protocols, procedures, and controls that are in place are meeting organizational needs. During this step, analysts identify potential weaknesses and determine whether the organization's tools, procedures, controls, and protocols should be changed to better manage potential risks

## Authorize 
Authorize means being accountable for the security and privacy risks that may exist in an organization. 
Eg. As an analyst, the authorization step could involve generating reports, developing plans of action, and establishing project milestones that are aligned to your organization's security goals.

## Monitor
Monitor means to be aware of how systems are operating. Assessing and maintaining technical operations are tasks that analysts complete daily. Part of maintaining a low level of risk for an organization is knowing how the current systems support the organization's security goals. If the systems in place don't meet those goals, changes may be needed.
