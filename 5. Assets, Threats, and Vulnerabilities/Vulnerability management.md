For every asset that needs protecting, there are dozens of vulnerabilities. Finding those vulnerabilities and fixing them before they become a problem is the key to keep an asset safe. A *vulnerability* is a weakness that can be exploited by a threat. 
Security teams plan to protect assets according to their vulnerabilities and how they can be exploited. In security, an *exploit* is a way of taking advantage of a vulnerability. Besides finding vulnerabilities, security planning relies a lot on thinking of exploits.

Security teams spend a lot of time finding vulnerabilities and thinking of how they can be exploited. They do this with the process known as vulnerability management. **Vulnerability management** is the process of finding and patching vulnerabilities. Vulnerability management helps keep assets safe. It's a method of stopping threats before they can become a problem. Vulnerability management is a four step process. 
- **Step 1**: Identify vulnerabilities 
- **Step 2**: Consider potential exploits of those vulnerabilities 
- **Step 3**: Prepare defenses against threats
- **Step 4**: Evaluate those defenses

When the last step ends, the process starts again. *Vulnerability management happens in a cycle*. It's a regular part of what security teams do because there are always new vulnerabilities to be concerned about.

This is why a diverse set of perspectives is useful! Having a wide range of backgrounds and experiences only strengthens security teams and their ability to find exploits. However, even large and diverse security teams can't keep track of everything.

New vulnerabilities are constantly being discovered. These are known as zero-day exploits. A **zero-day** is an exploit that was previously unknown. The term zero-day refers to the fact that the exploit is happening in real time with zero days to fix it. These kind of exploits are dangerous. They represent threats that haven't been planned for yet.

Vulnerability management is the process of finding vulnerabilities and fixing their exploits. That's why the process is performed regularly at most organizations. Perhaps the most important step of the process is identifying vulnerabilities.
