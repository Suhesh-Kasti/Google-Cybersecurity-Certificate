**Social engineering** is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.
These tactics trick people into breaking normal security procedures on the attacker's behalf. This can lead to *data exposures, widespread malware infections, or unauthorized access to restricted systems*. Social engineering attacks are a popular choice among threat actors. That’s because it’s often easier to trick people into providing them with access, information, or money than it is to exploit a software or network vulnerability.

Some attacks can take a matter of seconds to perform. For example, someone impersonating tech support asks an employee for their password to fix their computer. Other attacks can take months or longer, such as threat actors monitoring an employee's social media. The employee might post a comment saying they've gotten a temporary position in a new role at the company. An attacker might use an opportunity like this to target the temporary worker, who is likely to be less knowledgeable about security procedures.
Regardless of the timeframe, knowing what to look for can help you quickly identify and stop an attack in its tracks.

### Stages of social engineering
There are multiple stages of social engineering attacks. 
##### Prepare
At this stage, attackers gather information about their target. Using the intel, they'll determine the best way to exploit them.

##### Establish trust
This is often referred to as *pretexting*. Here, attackers use the information they gathered earlier to open a line of communication. They'll typically disguise themselves to trick their target into a false sense of trust.

##### Persuasion 
This stage is where the earlier preparation really matters. This is when the attacker manipulates their target into volunteering information. Sometimes they do this by using specific vocabulary that makes them sound like a member of the organization.

##### Disconnect from the target
After they collect the information they want, attackers break communication with their target. They disappear to cover their tracks.

### Signs of an attack

Oftentimes, people are unable to tell that an attack is happening until it's too late. Social engineering is such a dangerous threat because it typically allows attackers to bypass technological defenses that are in their way. Although these threats are difficult to prevent, recognizing the signs of social engineering is a key to reducing the likelihood of a successful attack.

These are common types of social engineering to watch out for:

- **Baiting** is a social engineering tactic that tempts people into compromising their security. A common example is USB baiting that relies on someone finding an infected USB drive and plugging it into their device.
    
- **Phishing** is the use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software. It is one of the most common forms of social engineering, typically performed via email.
    
- **Quid pro quo** is a type of baiting used to trick someone into believing that they’ll be rewarded in return for sharing access, information, or money. For example, an attacker might impersonate a loan officer at a bank and call customers offering them a lower interest rate on their credit card. They'll tell the customers that they simply need to provide their account details to claim the deal.
    
- **Tailgating** is a social engineering tactic in which unauthorized people follow an authorized person into a restricted area. This technique is also sometimes referred to as piggybacking.
    
- **Watering hole** is a type of attack when a threat actor compromises a website frequently visited by a specific group of users. Oftentimes, these watering hole sites are infected with malicious software. An example is the _Holy Water attack of 2020_ that infected various religious, charity, and volunteer websites.
    

Attackers might use any of these techniques to gain unauthorized access to an organization. Everyone is vulnerable to them, from entry-level employees to senior executives. However, you can reduce the risks of social engineering attacks at any business by teaching others what to expect.

## Encouraging caution

Spreading awareness usually starts with comprehensive security training. When it comes to social engineering, there are three main areas to focus on when teaching others:

- **Stay alert** of suspicious communications and unknown people, especially when it comes to email. For example, look out for spelling errors and double-check the sender's name and email address.
    
- **Be cautious** about sharing information, especially over social media. Threat actors often search these platforms for any information they can use to their advantage.
    
- **Control curiosity** when something seems too good to be true. This can include wanting to click on attachments or links in emails and advertisements.
    

**Pro tip:** Implementing technologies like firewalls, multi-factor authentication (MFA), block lists, email filtering, and others helps layers the defenses should someone make a mistake.

Ideally, security training extends beyond employees. Educating customers about social engineering threats is also a key to mitigating these threats. And security analysts play an important part in promoting safe practices. For example, a big part of an analyst's job is testing systems and documenting best practices for others at an organization to follow.


# Phishing

Phishing is the use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software. Phishing leverages many communication technologies, but the term is mainly used to describe attacks that arrive by email.
Phishing attacks don't just affect individuals. They are also harmful to organizations. A single employee that falls for one of these tricks can give malicious attackers access to systems. Once inside, attackers can exploit sensitive data like customer names and product secrets.

Attackers who carry out these attacks commonly use phishing kits. A **phishing kit** is a collection of software tools needed to launch a phishing campaign. People with little technical background can use one of these kits.
Each of the tools inside *are designed to avoid detection*. As a security professional, you should be aware of the three main tools inside a phishing kit, so that you can quickly identify when they're being used and put a stop to it.

##### What are inside kists?

**1. Malicious attachments**
These are files that are infected and can cause harm to the organization's systems.

**2. Fake-data collection forms**
These forms look like legitimate forms, like a survey. Unlike a real survey, they ask for sensitive information that isn't normally asked for in an email.

**3.Fraudulent web links**
These open to malicious web pages that are designed to look like trusted brands. Unlike actual websites, these fraudulent sites are built to steal information, like login credentials.

Cybercriminals can use these tools to launch a phishing attack in many forms. The most common is through malicious emails. However, they can use them in other forms of communication too. Most recently, cybercriminals are using smishing and vishing to trick people into revealing private information.

## Types of phishing

Phishing is one of the most common types of **social engineering**, which are manipulation techniques that exploit human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. Previously, you learned how **phishing** is the use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software. 

Sometimes, phishing attacks appear to come from a trusted person or business. This can lead unsuspecting recipients into acting against their better judgment, causing them to break security procedures. In this reading, you’ll learn about common phishing tactics used by attackers today.

## The origins of phishing

Phishing has been around since the early days of the internet. It can be traced back to the 1990s. At the time, people across the world were coming online for the first time. As the internet became more accessible it began to attract the attention of malicious actors. These malicious actors realized that the internet gave them a level of anonymity to commit their crimes.

### Early persuasion tactics

One of the earliest instances of phishing was aimed at a popular chat service called AOL Instant Messenger (AIM). Users of the service began receiving emails asking them to verify their accounts or provide personal billing information. The users were unaware that these messages were sent by malicious actors pretending to be service providers.

This was one of the first examples of mass phishing, which describes attacks that send malicious emails out to a large number of people, increasing the likelihood of baiting someone into the trap.

During the AIM attacks, malicious actors carefully crafted emails that appeared to come directly from AOL. The messages used official logos, colors, and fonts to trick unsuspecting users into sharing their information and account details.

Attackers used the stolen information to create fraudulent AOL accounts they could use to carry out other crimes anonymously. AOL was forced to adapt their security policies to address these threats. The chat service began including messages on their platforms to warn users about phishing attacks.

### How phishing has evolved

Phishing continued evolving at the turn of the century as businesses and newer technologies began entering the digital landscape. In the early 2000s, e-commerce and online payment systems started to become popular alternatives to traditional marketplaces. The introduction of online transactions presented new opportunities for attackers to commit crimes.

A number of techniques began to appear around this time period, many of which are still used today. There are five common types of phishing that every security analyst should know:

- **Email phishing** is a type of attack sent via email in which threat actors send messages pretending to be a trusted person or entity.
    
- **Smishing** is a type of phishing that uses Short Message Service (SMS), a technology that powers text messaging. Smishing covers all forms of text messaging services, including Apple’s iMessages, WhatsApp, and other chat mediums on phones.Smishing is the use of text messages to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source. Not only are smishing messages annoying to receive, they're also difficult to prevent. That's why some attackers send them. Some smishing messages are easy to detect. They might show signs of being malicious like promising a cash reward for clicking an attached link that shouldn't be clicked. Other times, smishing is hard to spot. Attackers sometimes use local area codes to appear legitimate. Some hackers can even send messages disguised as friends and families of their target to fool them into disclosing sensitive information.
	
- **Vishing** refers to the use of voice calls or voice messages to trick targets into providing personal information over the phone. Vishing is the exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or impersonate a known source. During vishing attacks, criminals pretend to be someone they're not. For example, attackers might call pretending to be a company representative. They might claim that there's a problem with your account. And they can offer to fix it if you provide them with sensitive information.
    
- **Spear phishing** is a subset of email phishing in which specific people are purposefully targeted, such as the accountants of a small business.
    
- **Whaling** refers to a category of spear phishing attempts that are aimed at high-ranking executives in an organization.
    

Since the early days of phishing, email attacks remain the most common types that are used. While they were originally used to trick people into sharing access credentials and credit card information, email phishing became a popular method to infect computer systems and networks with malicious software.

In late 2003, attackers around the world created fraudulent websites that resembled businesses like eBay and PayPal™. Mass phishing campaigns to distribute malicious programs were also launched against e-commerce and banking sites.

### Prevention tatics
Criminals who use social engineering are stealthy. The digital world has expanded their capabilities. It's also created more ways for them to go unnoticed. Still, there are ways that we can prevent their attacks.

**Implementing managerial controls** like policies, standards, and procedures, are one of the first lines of defense. Anti-phishing policies spread awareness and encourage users to follow data security procedures correctly. For example, businesses often follow the patch management standard defined in NIST Special Publication 800-40. These standards are used to create procedures for updating operating systems, applications, and firmware that can be exploited.

**Staying informed of trends** is also a major priority for any security professional. An even better defense against social engineering attacks is sharing what you know with others. Attackers play on our natural curiosity and desire to help one another. Their hope is that targets won't think too hard about what's going on. Teaching the signs of attack to others goes a long way towards preventing threats.

**Employee training resources** also help inform employees about things to look for when an email looks suspicious.

Another line of defense against phishing is **securing email inboxes**. Email filters are commonly used to keep harmful messages from reaching users. For example, specific email addresses can be blocked using a blocklist. Organizations often use other filters, like allowlists, to specify IP addresses that are approved to send mail within the company.
Organizations also use *intrusion prevention systems* to look for unusual patterns in email traffic. Security analysts use monitoring tools like this to spot suspicious emails, quarantine them, and produce a log of events.

### Recent trends

Starting in the 2010s, attackers began to shift away from mass phishing attempts that relied on baiting unsuspecting people into a trap. Leveraging new technologies, criminals began carrying out what’s known as targeted phishing attempts. Targeted phishing describes attacks that are sent to specific targets using highly customized methods to create a strong sense of familiarity.

A type of targeted phishing that evolved in the 2010s is angler phishing. **Angler phishing** is a technique where attackers impersonate customer service representatives on social media. This tactic evolved from people’s tendency to complain about businesses online. Threat actors intercept complaints from places like message boards or comment sections and contact the angry customer via social media. Like the AIM attacks of the 1990s, they use fraudulent accounts that appear similar to those of actual businesses. They then trick the angry customers into sharing sensitive information with the promise of fixing their problem.
