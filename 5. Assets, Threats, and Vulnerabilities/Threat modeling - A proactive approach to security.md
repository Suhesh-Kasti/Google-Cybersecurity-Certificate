Preparing for attacks is an important job that the entire security team is responsible for.
Threat actors have many tools they can use depending on their target.
For example, attacking a small business can be different from attacking a public utility.
Each have different assets and specific defenses to keep them safe. In all cases, anticipating attacks is the key to preparing for them. In security, we do that by performing an activity known as threat modeling.
**Threat modeling** is a process of identifying assets, their vulnerabilities, and how each is exposed to threats. We apply threat modeling to everything we protect. Entire systems, applications, or business processes all get examined from this security-related perspective.

Creating threat models is a *lengthy and detailed activity*. They're normally performed by a collection of individuals with years of experience in the field. Because of that, it's considered to be an advanced skill in security. However, that doesn't mean we won't be involved.

There are several threat modeling frameworks used in the field. Some are better suited for network security. Others are better for things like information security, or application development. In general, there are six steps of a threat model viz.

##### 1. Define the scope of the model
At this stage, the team determines what they're building by creating an inventory of assets and classifying them.

##### 2. Identify threats
Here, the team defines all potential threat actors. A threat actor is any person or group who presents a security risk. Threat actors are characterized as being *internal* or *external*.
For example, an internal threat actor could be an employee who intentionally expose an asset to harm. An example of an external threat actor could be a malicious hacker, or
a competing business. 
After threat actors have been identified, the team puts together what's known as an attack tree. An **attack tree** is a diagram that maps threats to assets. The team tries to be *as detailed as possible* when constructing this diagram before moving on.

##### 3. Characterize the environment
Here, the team applies an attacker mindset to the business. They consider how the customers and employees interact with the environment. Other factors they consider are *external partners* and *third party vendors*.

##### 4. Analyze threats
Here, the team works together to examine existing protections and identify gaps. They then rank threats according to their risk score that they assign.

##### 5. Mitigate risk
At this point, the group creates their plan for defending against threats. The choices here are to *avoid risk*, *transfer it*, *reduce it*, or *accept it*.

##### 6. Evaluate findings
At this stage, everything that was done during the exercise is *documented*, *fixes are applied*, and the team *makes note of any successes* they had. They also *record any lessons learned*, so they can inform how they approach future threat models.
