Weaknesses and flaws are generally found during a vulnerability assessment. A **vulnerability assessment** is the internal review process of an organization's security systems. These assessments work similar to the process of identifying and categorizing vulnerabilities on the CVE list. The main difference is the organization's security team performs, evaluates, scores, and fixes them on their own. Security analysts play a key role throughout this process.

##### The goal
The goal of a vulnerability assessment is to identify weak points and prevent attacks. They're also how security teams determine whether their security controls meet regulatory standards. Organizations perform vulnerability assessments a lot. Because companies have so many assets to protect, security teams sometimes need to select which area to focus on through vulnerability assessments.
Once they decide what to focus on, vulnerability assessments typically follow a four-step process:

### 1. **Identification**
Here, scanning tools and manual testing are used to find vulnerabilities. During the identification step, the goal is to understand the current state of a security system, like taking a picture of it.A large number of findings usually appear after identification. 

### 2. **Vulnerability Analysis**
During this step, each of the vulnerabilities that were identified are tested. By being a digital detective, the goal of vulnerability analysis is to find the source of the problem.

### 3. **Risk Assessment**
During this step of the process, a score is assigned to each vulnerability. This score is assigned based on two factors: *how severe the impact* would be if the vulnerability were to be exploited and the *likelihood of this happening*.
Vulnerabilities uncovered during the first two steps of this process often outnumber the people available to fix them. Risk assessments are a way of prioritizing resources to handle the vulnerabilities that need to be addressed based on their score.

### 4. **Remediation**
It's during this step that the vulnerabilities that can impact the organization are addressed. Remediation occurs depending on the severity score assigned during the risk assessment step.
This part of the process is normally a joint effort between the security staff and IT teams to come up with the best approach to fixing the vulnerabilities that were uncovered earlier. Examples of remediation steps might include things like enforcing new security procedures, updating operating systems, or implementing system patches.

# Approaches to vulnerability scanning

**Vulnerability assessment**, is the internal review process of an organization's security systems. An organization performs vulnerability assessments to identify weaknesses and prevent attacks. Vulnerability scanning tools are commonly used to simulate threats by finding vulnerabilities in an attack surface. They also help security teams take proactive steps towards implementing their remediation strategy.

Vulnerability scanners are important tools that you'll likely use in the field. In this reading, you’ll explore how vulnerability scanners work and the types of scans they can perform.

## What is a vulnerability scanner?

A **vulnerability scanner** is software that automatically compares known vulnerabilities and exposures against the technologies on the network. In general, these tools scan systems to find misconfigurations or programming flaws.

1. **Perimeter layer**, like authentication systems that validate user access
    
2. **Network layer**, which is made up of technologies like network firewalls and others
    
3. **Endpoint layer**, which describes devices on a network, like laptops, desktops, or servers
    
4. **Application layer**, which involves the software that users interact with
    
5. **Data layer**, which includes any information that’s stored, in transit, or in use
    

When a scan of any layer begins, the scanning tool compares the findings against databases of security threats. At the end of the scan, the tool flags any vulnerabilities that it finds and adds them to its reference database. Each scan adds more information to the database, helping the tool be more accurate in its analysis.

**Note:** Vulnerability databases are also routinely updated by the company that designed the scanning software.

## Performing scans

Vulnerability scanners are meant to be non-intrusive. Meaning, they don’t break or take advantage of a system like an attacker would. Instead, they simply scan a surface and alert you to any potentially unlocked doors in your systems.

**Note:** While vulnerability scanners are non-intrusive, there are instances when a scan can inadvertently cause issues, like crash a system.

There are a few different ways that these tools are used to scan a surface. Each approach corresponds to the pathway a threat actor might take. Next, you can explore each type of scan to get a clearer picture of this. 

**External vs. internal**

External and internal scans simulate an attacker's approach.

_External scans_ test the perimeter layer outside of the internal network. They analyze outward facing systems, like websites and firewalls. These kinds of scans can uncover vulnerable things like vulnerable network ports or servers.

_Internal scans_ start from the opposite end by examining an organization's internal systems. For example, this type of scan might analyze application software for weaknesses in how it handles user input.

### **Authenticated vs. unauthenticated**

Authenticated and unauthenticated scans simulate whether or not a user has access to a system.

_Authenticated scans_ might test a system by logging in with a real user account or even with an admin account. These service accounts are used to check for vulnerabilities, like broken access controls.

_Unauthenticated scans_ simulate external threat actors that do not have access to your business resources. For example, a scan might analyze file shares within the organization that are used to house internal-only documents. Unauthenticated users should receive "access denied" results if they tried opening these files. However, a vulnerability would be identified if you were able to access a file.

### **Limited vs. comprehensive**

Limited and comprehensive scans focus on particular devices that are accessed by internal and external users.

_Limited scans_ analyze particular devices on a network, like searching for misconfigurations on a firewall.

_Comprehensive scans_ analyze all devices connected to a network. This includes operating systems, user databases, and more.

**Pro tip:** Discovery scanning should be done prior to limited or comprehensive scans. Discovery scanning is used to get an idea of the computers, devices, and open ports that are on a network.
