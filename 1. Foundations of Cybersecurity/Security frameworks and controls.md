Security frameworks are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy. 
Security frameworks provide a structured approach to implementing a security lifecycle.

## Security Lifecycle
The security lifecycle is a constantly evolving set of policies and standards that define how an organization manages risks, follows established guidelines, and meets regulatory compliance, or laws.

### Purposes of security frameworks :
- protecting personally identifiable information, known as PII,
- securing financial information, 
- identifying security weaknesses, 
- managing organizational risks, 
- and aligning security with business goals.

### Components of security framework
- identifying and documenting security goals 
- setting guidelines to achieve security goals
- implementing strong security processes
- monitoring and communicating results

## Security controls
They are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. 
For example, your company may have a guideline that requires all employees to complete a privacy training to reduce the risk of data breaches. 
As a security analyst, you may use a software tool to automatically assign and track which employees have completed this training.

**Compliance** is the process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations.
The more aligned an organization is with compliance, the lower the risk.
