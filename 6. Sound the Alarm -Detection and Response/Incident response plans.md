When an incident occurs, incident response teams must be prepared to respond quickly, efficiently, and effectively. Whether it's a data breach, DDoS attack, or ransomware, incidents have the potential to cause significant damage to an organization. Regulations may require organizations to report incidents within a certain timeframe. So it's crucial for organizations *to have a formal incident response plan* in place, so there's a prepared and consistent process to quickly respond to incidents once they occur.

Security plans consist of three basic elements: *policies*, *standards*, and *procedures*. An incident response plan is a document that outlines the procedures to take in each step of incident response.
Response plans, just like response teams, are not all the same. Organizations tailor their plans to meet their unique requirements such as their mission, size, culture, industry, and structure. For example, smaller organizations may choose to include their incident response plan in their security plan, while others may choose to have them as separate documents.
Although not all incident plans are the same, there are common elements that they share.

Incident plans have: 
##### 1. Incident response procedures
These are *step-by-step instructions* on how to respond to incidents. 
##### 2. System information
These are things like *network diagrams*, *data flow diagrams*, *logging*, and *asset inventory information*. And other documents like *contact lists, forms, and templates*.

Plans aren't perfect, and there's always room to adjust and improve as incidents occur. Incident processes and procedures must be regularly reviewed and tested.
This can be done through exercises like tabletops or simulations. These exercises ensure that all team members are familiar with the response plan. They also allow organizations to identify any missing gaps in a process to improve their incident response plan. Also, organizations may be required to complete specific types of exercises for regulatory reasons.

### Incident response tools
We use *detection and management tools* to monitor system activity to identify events that require investigation. We use **documentation tools** to *collect and compile evidence*. And we also use different **investigative tools** for *analyzing these events*, like packet sniffers. New security technologies emerge, threats evolve, and attackers become stealthier to avoid detection. To become effective at detecting threats, we need to continuously expand your security toolbox.
