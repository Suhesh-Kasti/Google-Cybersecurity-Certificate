The third phase of the incident response lifecycle includes the steps for how security teams contain, eradicate, and recover from an incident. It's important to note that these steps interrelate. Containment helps meet the goals of eradication, which helps meet the goals of recovery. This phase of the lifecycle also integrates with the core functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, Respond and Recover. 
##### Containment:
After an incident has been detected, it must be contained. **Containment** is the act of limiting and preventing additional damage caused by an incident. Organizations outline their containment strategies in incident response plans. Containment strategies detail the actions that security teams should take after an incident has been detected. Different containment strategies are used for various incident types. For example, a common containment strategy
for a malware incident on a single computer system is to isolate the affected system by disconnecting it from the network. This prevents the spread of the malware to other systems in the network. As a result, the incident is contained to the single compromised system, which limits any further damage. Containment actions are the first step toward removing a threat from an environment. 
##### Eradication:
Once an incident has been contained, security teams work to remove all traces of the incident through eradication. **Eradication** involves the complete removal of the incident elements from all affected systems. For example, eradication actions include performing
vulnerability tests and applying patches to vulnerabilities related to the threat. 
##### Recovery:
Finally, the last step of this phase in the incident response lifecycle is recovery. Recovery is the process of returning affected systems back to normal operations. An incident can disrupt
key business operations and services. During recovery, any services that were impacted by
the incident are brought back to normal operation. Recovery actions include: reimaging  affected systems, resetting passwords, and adjusting network configurations like firewall rules.

The incident response lifecycle is cyclical. Multiple incidents can happen across
time and these incidents can be related. Security teams may have to circle back to other phases in the lifecycle to conduct additional investigations.
